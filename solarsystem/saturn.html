                        <p>The second largest planet in the solar system after Jupiter, and the sixth in terms of
                            distance from the Sun. Saturn is a gas giant with a radius approximately nine times that of
                            Earth. Saturn's density is one-eighth that of Earth, but its volume is 95 times that
                            of Earth.Saturn's upper atmosphere is mostly mild and calm. Nevertheless, long-lasting
                            atmospheric phenomena can also be observed. Saturn's wind speed is 1,800 km/h, which is
                            stronger than that of Jupiter and weaker than that of Neptune. In January 2019,
                            researchers determined that one Saturn day is 10 hours 33 minutes 38 seconds (Â± 1 minute 19
                            seconds) based on studies of Saturn's C ring.
