                        <p>The seventh planet in terms of proximity to the Sun. It is the third largest planet in the
                            solar system by radius and fourth by mass. The composition of Uranus is the same as that of
                            Neptune, and both contain the same chemical elements, which differentiate them from the
                            large gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists classify Uranus and Neptune
                            as "ice giants" to distinguish them from gas giants. Although Uranus' atmosphere is similar
                            to that of Saturn and Jupiter, with a composition of mostly hydrogen and helium, it contains
                            more ice along with ammonia, methane, and other hydrocarbons.
